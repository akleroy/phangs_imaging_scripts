# IMAGING RECIPES KEY
##########################################################################

# The imaging pipeline builds "clean_call" objects that repeatedly
# call tclean to build a deconvolved interferometric image. This
# imaging recipes key links combinations of "config"uration, spectral
# "product", and imaging step (see below) to "recipes." These recipes
# are sets of tclean parameters similar to those written out by
# save_input in CASA.

# Note that some pipeline recipes overwrite some parameters, like
# niter, scales, or (when using dynamic sizing) cell and imsize. The
# parameters provided here serve as a base.

# ALSO NOTE THAT ORDER IS VERY IMPORTANT HERE! The recipes are read in
# as lists, which are applied ***in the order that they are read
# in***. So a parameter in later recipe will override the same
# parameter in the earlier recipe.
 
# The columns in the file are:

# Column 1: Configuration ("all" is okay)
# Column 2: Product ("all_line", "all_cont" are okay)
# Column 3: What stage of the imaging process does this apply to? (all/dirty/multiscale/singlescale)
# Column 4: Name of the clean parameter file.

# Column 1: Configuration can be "all" or any valid interf_config defined in
# config_key.txt.

# Column 2: Product. Similarly, product can be any line or continuum
# product defined in config_key.txt.

# Column 3: Stage. This is the stage of the imaging process. For the
# basic phangsalma recipe, the valid values are
# "all","dirty","multiscale","singlescale"

# Column 4: The name of the clean parameter file to be read in. Should
# be in this keys directory.
