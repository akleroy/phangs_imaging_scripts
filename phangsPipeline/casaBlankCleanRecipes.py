# This is a very simple SCRIPT (not a module) that will generate blank
# clean input files. These can be used as the basis of clean recipes.

# The main use is to generate a new complete set of default-value
# clean fields for use building a clean call when a new version of
# CASA comes out. The resulting clean recipes can be fed as input to
# the CleanCall object for pipeline imaging.
