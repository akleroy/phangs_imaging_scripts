# This script carries out the imaging. It makes a dirty image, reads
# and aligns the user-supplied clean mask, carries out multiscale
# imaging down to S/N ~ 4, builds a mask of bright emission, carries
# out a single scale clean down to low S/N within this mask, and then
# exports the output to FITS.

# Right now it should work well for CO21 and C18O21. Imaging of the
# two-d products is still TBD.

# Edit the "Control Flow" section to use the script.

# WARNING! Right now a bug prevents the script from stopping and
# starting effectively, so it needs to be run end-to-end to work. This
# shouldn't be a big problem for the 7m data.

# ... set these variables to indicate what steps of the script should
# be performed. The steps do:

# make_dirty_image - make a niter=0 image cube. Useful for checking
# mosaic parameters and that sort of thing. Used as a template for the
# clean mask, so this needs to be done first.

# revert_to_dirty - (DOES NOT WORK RIGHT NOW) reset the whole process
# so that the cube is now the dirty cube. Unfortunately there's some
# 'memory' related to the clean call in CASA that is causing a bug so
# that things don't cleanly resume from here.

# read_in_clean_mask - if a clean mask is found in the ../clean_masks/
# directory, read it in and align it to the astrometric grid of the
# dirty image. This is now the .mask file and will be used in future
# imaging.

# run_multiscale_clean - run a multiscale clean using a set of scales
# selected for that array combination. By default, clean down to a
# signal to noise of 4 in the residuals or stop when successive
# iterations of clean change the flux in the model by less than 2%.

# revert_to_multiscale - (DOES NOT WORK RIGHT NOW) reset the process
# to just after the multiscale clean. See revert_to_dirty above.

# make_singlescale_mask - construct a signal-to-noise based mask for
# use in single scale clean. Uses the .image to do this, so that
# bright regions in the image so far get more cleaning. This maks is
# joined with the clean mask, so no regions are included outside the
# clean mask.

# run_singlescale_clean - run a single scale hogbom clean inside the
# bright regions defined above. Clean with a very low (S/N ~ 1)
# threshold and stop based on convergence in flux between successive
# model images.

# export_to_fits - export the dirt, multiscale, and final images and
# associated products to FITS files for subsequent processing.
 
# Right now I recommend to not change the flow, and to rerun imaging
# from beginning to end when using the script.
