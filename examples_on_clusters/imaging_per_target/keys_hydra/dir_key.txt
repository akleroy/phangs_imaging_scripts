# DIRECTORY MAPPING KEY
##########################################################################

# Key to map from target to working directory name.

# BY DEFAULT the working directory for any target is a directory with
# the same name as the target. The programs will create this directory
# in the imaging, postprocessing, etc. directories.

# This key allows targets to be mapped to other directories.

# The most common use is to combine several targets into a single
# directory. This comes up for PHANGS-ALMA in the context of linear
# mosaics. Several targets are observed and then larter combined into
# a single data cube. Thus we prefer to image and process these parts
# together in a single directory.

# The syntax for the key is space or tab delimited:

# Column 1: target name
# Column 2: working directory name

# In PHANGS-ALMA the convention is to map parts to a working directory
# with the name of the full galaxy. For example:

#circinus_1       circinus
#circinus_2       circinus
