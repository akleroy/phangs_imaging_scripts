# MASTER KEY
##########################################################################

# VERY IMPORTANT! The pipeline (currently) operates on absolute path
# definitions. Even if you are using an otherwise already set up
# project, please set these absolute file paths to be appropriate to
# for your system before running the pipeline!

# The master key defines the directory structure for the project and
# links to the other keys that define configurations, targets, uv
# data, algorithmic choices, etc. for the project.

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------
# DIRECTORIES
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 'key_dir' 

# is the location all the key files used by an individual pipeline
# product. This file is almost certainly in your key_dir.
 
# 'ms_root' 

# is any directory in which the calibrated measurement sets (listed in
# the ms_key below) are located. These directories are pre-pended to
# the file paths in ms_key to identify the locations of the uv data.

# You can set more than one 'ms_root' below to have multiple search
# paths for the measurement sets defined in the 'ms_key' below.
 
# 'cleanmask_root' 

# is the root directory storing all the clean mask FITS
# cubes. Currently clean masks are treated as an external input to the
# process. This is likely to change in the near future.
 
# 'singledish_root' 

# is the root directory storing all the single dish imaged FITS
# cubes. Currently single dish data are treated as an external input
# to the process. For PHANGS-ALMA these are output by the separate
# total power pipeline. This is might change at some point in the
# future, but not the near term.

# You can set more than one 'singledish_root' below to have multiple
# search paths for the measurement sets defined in the
# 'singledish_key' below.
 
# 'imaging_root' 

# is the root directory for staging and process the visibility data
# and imaging. Each individual target will have a subdirectory of this
# imaging directory where processing for that target occurs.
 
# 'postprocess_root' 

# is the root directory for processing the imaged cube, including
# feathering and linear mosaicking. Each individual target will have a
# subdirectory of this imaging directory where processing for that
# target occurs.

# 'product_root' 

# is the root directory for creating data products, like moment maps
# and masks from the postprocessed image cubes. Each individual target
# will have a subdirectory of this imaging directory where processing
# for that target occurs.
 
# 'release_root' 

# is the root directory for creating a distributed release. Currently,
# each individual target will have a subdirectory of this imaging
# directory where processing for that target occurs, though this may
# change.

# FILES GIVING LOCATIONS OF INPUT DATA
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
# These are files giving the location of input data to be processed by
# the pipeline. Right now, we expect list of input uv data (ms_key),
# single dish data (singledish_key), and clean masks (cleanmask_key).

# These key files should be exist (or be defined relative to the
# 'key_dir' path set above). The easiest solution is to put all the
# keys in the same directory.
 
# ms_key 

# The data file(s) that list the individual u-v data used by the
# project. Each entry maps from a calibrated u-v data set to a target
# name, array tag, and project tag.
 
# These measurement sets need to be calibrated in advance, e.g., with
# the ALMA calibration pipeline or VLA pipeline.

# singledish_key

# The data file(s) that list individual single dish FITS files for use
# in feathering. Each entry maps from a target and product to a single
# dish cube.

# The pipeline expects the calibrated single dish data to already
# exist, e.g., as output by the PHANGS-ALMA total power pipeline.
 
# cleanmask_key 

# The data file(s) that list individual clean masks as FITS
# files. These are used in imaging. Each entry maps from a target and
# product to a clean mask. This may be deprecated in the near future
# as algorithic clean mask creation is migrated into the pipeline.

#ms_key               ms_file_key.txt
#singledish_key       singledish_key.txt

# FILES DEFINING TARGETS AND ALGORITHMS
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
# config_key

# This file defines the configurations of lines, inteferometric
# arrays, and combinations of interferometric and total power data
# looped over by the pipeline. It defines "products" (which are
# spectral data products, like CO 2-1 or continuum) and
# "configurations" (which are combinations of inteferometer and single
# dish data).
 
# target_key

# The file containing the phase centers, velocities, and widths for
# each target. The velocity information is used for gridding,
# continuum extraction, identifying spectral windows, etc.. The
# position information can be taken as the phase center of the image
# during imaging.

# linmos_key

# This file maps targets to linear mosaics. Linear mosaics combine
# individual targets into a single image as part of
# post-processing. This has some redundancy with the directory key,
# but in theory targets might be processed separately and still
# mosaicked, so the keys both exist but look very similar. In
# principle, the same file could be assigned to both.

# dir_key

# The (optional) mapping between target and directory within the
# working directory. Use this, e.g., to image and process target
# 'ngc3627_1' in the directory 'ngc3627'.
 
# imaging_key

# This file maps between product and configuration combinations to
# clean parameter files of the type saved by save_input in CASA. These
# parameters get read in as the baseline values for cleaning using
# that config/product combination, they are then modified by the
# imaging scripts and cleaning procedures.

# override_key

# This file contains by hand overrides for the post-processing and
# imaging steps. These are specific things and not required, but,
# e.g., allow a different weighting or cell size for specific data
# sets. Most of these capabilities are currently not implemented.
